634	1	For practical purposes,  the culpable causing of another person 's death may fairly be regarded as the most serious offence in the criminal calendar.	verb	23
635	1	There is an argument that treason is a more serious offence,  since it strikes at the very foundations of the State and its social organizations,  but treason is so rare that it is surely permissible to treat homicide as the most serious form of crime.	verb	17
636	1	There are still awkward questions to be confronted.	verb	7
637	1	Forexample,  are we satisfied that the 600 deaths recorded as homicide are in fact more culpable than all,  or even most,  of the deaths recorded as accidents?	verb	15
638	1	It will be seen that English law does this upto a point,  and in the process seems to accept -defence arguments as reasons for departing from several of the principles set out in Chapter 3.	verb	19
639	1	The ‘ year and a day ’ rule is a legacy of times when medical science was so rudimentary that,  if there was a substantial lapse of time between injury and death,  it was unsafe to pronounce on whether the defendant 's conduct or some other event caused the death.	verb	36
640	1	It might also be argued that the mandatory life sentence makes a substantial contribution to public safety.	verb	12
641	1	The mandatory penalty does indeed serve to mark out murder from other crimes,  but whether the definition of murder is sufficiently refined to capture the worst killings,  and only the worst killings,  remains to be discussed below.	verb	21
642	1	Whether the life sentence is regarded as a sufficient denunciation in society depends on the public 's perception of what life imprisonment means:  if it is widely believed that it results in an average of nine years ' imprisonment,  the effect will be somewhat blunted.	verb	44
643	1	In procedural terms,  therefore,  the life sentence involves a transfer of function:  normally it is the judge who determines the sentence ( or atleast its upper limit,  since earlier release on parole may be possible ),  whereas a life sentence entrusts that function to the executive,  who must first ascertain the opinions of the Lord Chief Justice and the trial judge.	verb	9
644	1	Whatever the justifications for introducing this policy,  it serves to underline the fact that sentencing in murder cases is enacted without each case being considered individually,  after hearing representations from the offender 's counsel,  and without a sentence announced in court and subjectto appeal.	verb	19
645	1	In cases where life imprisonment was thought to be the appropriate sentence,  the trial judge would still specify—  in open court—  the number of years to be spent in prison,  taking the gravity of the offence into account,  and release would be determined by a judicial tribunal.	verb	32
646	1	Many American jurisdictions have three degrees of murder—  degree murder,  requiring premeditation,  and second- and degree murder,  covering lesser shades of culpability.	verb	19
647	1	That cost is not difficult to justify where capital punishment is the penalty for degree murder.	verb	14
648	1	Where there is no capital punishment,  however,  the question of how many degrees of homicide it is desirable to have calls for careful weighing of the principle of fair labelling ( see Chapter 3.3 ( l ) ) against the cost and time arguments mobilised by the policy of efficient administration ( see Chapter 3.3 ( m ) ).	verb	44
649	1	Although there are two offences,  murder and manslaughter,  the latter includes two distinct varieties:  ‘ voluntary ’ manslaughter ( killings which would be murder butfor the existence of defined extenuating circumstances );  and ‘ involuntary ’ manslaughter ( killings for which there is no need to prove any awareness of the risk of death being caused,  but for which there is thought to be sufficient fault to justify criminal liability ).	verb	28
650	1	Intent to kill may be regarded as the most obvious and indisputable form of fault element for murder,  but to some extent that depends on the meaning of ‘ intent ’.	verb	15
651	1	In this way,  both purpose and foresight of practical certainty are regarded as part of the definition of intent,  although there are other statements suggesting that foresight of practical or ‘ virtual ’ certainty is merely evidence from which intent may be inferred.	verb	11
652	1	What about the alternative element in the definition,  an intent to cause grievous bodily harm?	verb	4
653	1	The House of Lords upheld D 's conviction for murder:  an intent to cause really serious injury is sufficient for murder,  without any proof that the defendant intended,  or even contemplated,  the possibility that death would result.	verb	30
654	1	Does the ‘ grievous bodily harm ’ rule extend the definition of murder too far?	verb	8
655	1	Intermsof principle,  the rule requires justification because it departs from the principle of correspondence ( see Chapter 5.2(a) ),  namely that the fault element in a crime should relate to the consequences prohibited by that crime.	verb	8
656	1	Why should it be necessary to ‘ construct ’ a murder conviction outof this lesser intent?	verb	7
657	1	There are arguments infavourof this:  death is final,  murder is the gravest crime,  and there is no significant moral difference between someone who chooses to cause really serious injury and someone who sets out to kill.	verb	7
658	1	If one person chooses to cause serious injury to another,  it should be presumed that he or she realizes that there is always a risk of death,  and such cases show a sufficiently wanton disregard for life asto warrant the label ‘ murder ’ if death results.	verb	33
659	1	The counter-arguments,  which would uphold the principle of correspondence,  are that breach of that principle is unnecessary when the amplitude of the crime of manslaughter lies beneath murder,  and also that the definition of grievous bodily harm includes a number of injuries which are most unlikely to put the victim 's life at risk.	verb	19
660	1	So in practice the ‘ grievous bodily harm ’ rule goes further than the arguments of its protagonists would support.	verb	17
661	1	That would have the merit of simplicity,  but would it strike the right note socially?	verb	10
662	1	Yet if the example is modified alittle,  sothat the overtaking is on a country road at night and the risk is known to be slight,  it becomes questionable whether the causing of death in these circumstances should be labelled in the same way as intentional killings.	verb	38
663	1	In discussing the boundaries of murder,  we are concerned with classification,  not exculpation.	verb	3
664	1	Both the Model Penal Code test and the Scots test may be reduced to circularity,  however,  for when one asks how extreme or how wicked the recklessness should be,  the only possible answer is:  ‘ wicked or extreme enough to justify the stigma of a murder conviction ’.	verb	24
665	1	Both the Model Penal Code test and the Scots test may be reduced to circularity,  however,  for when one asks how extreme or how wicked the recklessness should be,  the only possible answer is:  ‘ wicked or extreme enough to justify the stigma of a murder conviction ’.	verb	35
666	1	Admittedly,  the Model Penal Code does contain a list of circumstances which may amount to extreme indifference,  which assists the courts and increases the predictability of verdicts in a way that Scots law does not,  but the essence of both approaches is that there is no precise way of describing those non-intentional killings which are as heinous as intentional killings.	verb	15
667	1	Admittedly,  the Model Penal Code does contain a list of circumstances which may amount to extreme indifference,  which assists the courts and increases the predictability of verdicts in a way that Scots law does not,  but the essence of both approaches is that there is no precise way of describing those non-intentional killings which are as heinous as intentional killings.	verb	37
668	1	Their protagonists argue that the law of murder is so important socially that derogation from the principle of maximum certainty should be allowed infavourof more accurate labelling by the courts;  opponents argue that the principle of maximum certainty is needed here specifically to reduce the risk of verdicts based on discriminatory or irrelevant factors,  suchas distaste for the defendant 's background,  allegiance,  or other activities.	verb	1
669	1	Their protagonists argue that the law of murder is so important socially that derogation from the principle of maximum certainty should be allowed infavourof more accurate labelling by the courts;  opponents argue that the principle of maximum certainty is needed here specifically to reduce the risk of verdicts based on discriminatory or irrelevant factors,  suchas distaste for the defendant 's background,  allegiance,  or other activities.	verb	26
670	1	A third,  more precise formulation derives from the recommendations of the Criminal Law Revision Committee in 1980,  namely,  that a killing should be classified as murder in those situations where there is an intention to cause serious injury coupled with awareness of the risk of death.	verb	4

1311	1	VISTA made science more girl friendly in two ways:  both boys and girls were offered an attractive image of a competent woman scientist,  and talks concentrated on social and industrial applications of science,  an element too often missing from science at school.	verb	16
1312	1	VISTA made science more girl friendly in two ways:  both boys and girls were offered an attractive image of a competent woman scientist,  and talks concentrated on social and industrial applications of science,  an element too often missing from science at school.	verb	34
1313	1	Atpresent the science curriculum is structured around physical science interests,  on which boys are keener ( how motor cars work,  atoms and molecules );  we were able to recommend that teaching build on the overlapping interests of the two sexes,  because girls aswellas boys want to know more about human biology and spectacular features of the environment ( animals in the jungle,  volcanoes and earthquakes,  acids and chemicals ).	verb	14
1314	1	These examples indicate some of the features of girl friendly science:  it builds on girls ' interests,  not just boys ';  it explicitly encourages girls to see themselves as potential scientists,  and it includes some of the social and human implications and applications of science.	verb	2
1315	1	For a more girl friendly science,  it seems vital that teachers should come to see that when all the masculine packaging,  evident in textbooks and resources aswellas teachers ' and boys ' behaviour in the classroom,  is removed,  girls can be very enthusiastic about science.  [… ]	verb	20
1316	1	First,  the pupils,  teachers and practitioners of science are overwhelmingly male intermsof numbers;  second,  school science is packaged and presented to appeal to boys,  not girls;  third,  classroom behaviours and interaction operate to reconstruct science as a male activity,  and finally it has been suggested that ‘ scientific ’ thinking embodies an intrinsically masculine world view.	verb	33
1317	1	The fourth point,  the idea that science is intrinsically masculine,  can be sustained only by clinging to an irredeemably narrow conception of science and scientific thinking.	verb	19

1320	1	The fourth section examines the formidable barriers that were posed by reorganisation of social services,  local authority cuts and the demise of the Inner London Education Authority.	verb	5
1321	1	Some integrated services emerged in the early 1980s—  one playscheme was developed through a parent 's initiative,  and an integrated adventure playground was established by a voluntary organisation.	verb	3
1322	1	These ideas were informed by a paper which had already been produced by an active member of the local Mencap group,  who had previously tried to generate the debate within the Community Health Service through the Mencap committee. 	verb	26
1323	1	Over against the German army or the Vichy government,  where social generality ruled,  as it does in all machines of state,  the Resistance offered the rare phenomenon of historical action which remained personal.	verb	18
1324	1	The Resistance was a unique experience for them,  and they wanted to preserve its experience in the new French politics because this experience broke awayfrom the famous dilemma of being and doing,  which confronts all intellectuals in the face of action….	verb	33
1325	1	It is only too obvious that this balance between action and personal life was intimately bound up with the conditions of clandestine action and could not survive it.	verb	14
1326	1	And in this sense it must be said that the Resistance experience,  by making us believe that politics is a relationship between man and man or between consciousnesses,  fostered our illusions of 1939 and masked the truth of the incredible power of history which the Occupation taught us in another connection.	verb	28
1327	1	Accordingly,  he attempted to shift Marxism awayfrom orthodox theories of an absolute determinism towards the primacy of a concept of ‘ History ’ which,  while still a totality as it had been for Lukács,  a process with a determinate meaning and end,  could also include a concept of human agency and thus articulate the individual with the social,  freedom with determinism.	verb	52
1328	1	Today,  Sartre 's voluntarism is to some extent returning to favour as the result of a desire to retrieve the categories of agency and the subject,  which goes together with the wish to get outof the apparently totalizing systems of Adorno,  Althusser or Foucault.	verb	18
1329	1	Sartre 's stress on the role of the subject also finds approval because many of those nolonger prepared to argue for a general theory of history as the progress of a single narrative of struggle,  have begun to argue instead for a return of its correlative,  the subject,  almost asif it was the next best thing in the absence of history itself.	verb	32
1330	1	Sartre considered that orthodox dialectical materialism takes the easy way out by merely eliminating the first infavourof the second,  making man a passive product entirely determined by economic circumstances.	verb	13

1332	1	Its corollary,  whereby praxis becomes determining history,  he called the ‘ inert ’,  by which he meant the material circumstances that have themselves been created by previous praxes and which form the conditions for new praxis.	verb	11
1333	1	Though this neatly solves the problem of how man can make history while at the same time history makes him,  it does not answer the larger question of how a multiplicity of the products of individual acts,  ‘ totalizations ’,  can themselves be totalized into the overall totalization required by the logic of dialectical rationality—  ratherthan being the arbitrary,  blind and self-cancelling movements of,  say,  Hardy 's immanent will.	verb	59
1334	1	Sartre 's fundamental thesis,  that ‘ History continually effects totalisations of totalisations ’ ( I,  15 ),  does not in itself answer what Ronald Aronson has rightly characterized as question for Sartre:  ‘ how do separate,  antagonistic actions yield history;  how do individual totalizations lead to Totalization ( and also progress,  the direction of history,  its truth and its meaning )? ’	verb	36
1335	1	The dialectic is the law of totalization which creates collectivities,  societies,  and history—  realities,  thatis,  which impose themselves on individuals;  but at the same time it must be woven outof millions of individual actions.	verb	28
1336	1	At the moment,  ‘ history is made without being known history constitutes,  we might say today,  a political unconscious.	verb	18
1337	1	‘ Marxism ’,  on the other hand,  Sartre claims,  ‘ is History itself becoming conscious of itself ’ ( I,  40 ):  asfor Lukács,  it is by becoming conscious of itself as the subject of history that the working class will understand history 's meaning—  and so recognize itself as the meaning of history.	verb	14

1339	1	While he suggests in apocalyptic tones in that this process of self-consciousness is atlast beginning to take place,  and that civil,  foreign and colonial wars are becoming apparent as different forms of a single class struggle,  Sartre also admits that the divorce between theory and praxis which ensued under Stalinism has generally prevented any clear self-consciousness among the masses.	verb	5

1341	1	The ‘ detour,  of Stalinism is thus formalized as Marxism 's own descent into its unconscious,  resulting in a dream-work of heterogeneous histories that have eluded systematization and subsumption into the single meaning of Marxism 's own reading of history.	verb	19
1342	1	The ‘ detour,  of Stalinism is thus formalized as Marxism 's own descent into its unconscious,  resulting in a dream-work of heterogeneous histories that have eluded systematization and subsumption into the single meaning of Marxism 's own reading of history.	verb	25
1343	1	It is therefore,  Sartre argues,  our historical task to make it known,  promoting not just the historical process as such,  but also the general recognition whereby the plurality of the meanings of individual histories can be seen to combine to make one history,  with one meaning—  the ‘ Truth of humanity ’ ( I,  822 ).	verb	24
1344	1	Sartre 's account thus sets up the articulation of history,  univocal meaning,  and totality as the indissoluble set of elements required for the validation of Marxism,  necessary inorder to save it from its detour from itself.	verb	19

1348	1	Sartre produces a persuasive formulation of the relation of the individual to the determining historical circumstance through his concepts of praxis and the inert;  it is also obvious to him how the larger question of History ought to be solved.	verb	4
1349	1	He attempts to solve this through matching his account of contradiction with a new concept derived from the conjunction of work and labour:  ‘ anti-labour ’ ( ),  a category of negation.	verb	15

1354	1	In the dialectical perspective,  we encounter these objects as productions which are human and provided with a future…  thus they seem by themselves to be totalizations in process.	verb	3

1359	1	In the context of the negativity of this formulation,  Sartre is obliged to pose onceagain the problem of whether there can be a totalization,  without any independent totalizer or totalizing force suchas the dialectic,  or whether the structure of negation that he has described means that,  asfor Adorno or Bakhtin,  history does not develop positively but,  rather,  negatively,  and is therefore instead detotalizing:	verb	8

1365	1	Our goal is solely to establish whether,  in a practical ensemble torn apart by antagonism ( whether there are multiple conflicts or whether they are reduced to one ) the breaks themselves are totalizing and carried along by the totalizing movement of the ensemble.	verb	10
1366	1	At this point Sartre confronts the possibility that the whole project of the,  stated so confidently on its very first page—  ‘ it must be proved that a negation of a negation can be an affirmation ’ ( I,  15 )—  may break down.	verb	4

1369	1	perhaps the Truth of History can not be proved;  its direction can not be discerned.	verb	14
1370	1	Sartre 's reaction to the threat that the negation of a negation may produce a detotalizing effect is to introduce a new category,  a unifying force of a ‘ singularization ’ which incarnates the universal:  ‘ If totalization really is an ongoing process ’,  he writes,  ‘ then it operates everywhere.	verb	11
1371	1	That means both that there is a dialectical meaning of the practical ensemble…  and that each singular event totalizes in itself the practical ensemble in the infinite richness of its singularity ’ ( II,  26 ).	verb	27
1372	1	Unlike Lukács ' insignificant event from which the universal is precariously drawn out through the narrative,  Sartre 's singularity works synecdochally in a conventional antinomy with the universal,  the relation between the two structured accordingto the familiar nineteenth-century model of organic growth or process in which each singular event makes up the whole while,  as he puts it,  ‘ the whole is entirely present in the part as its present meaning and as its destiny ’.	verb	40
1373	1	Sartre 's ‘ singular universal ’,  therefore,  begs the question,  for it is predicated on the assumption that,  if there is not a totality as such,  then there already is an overall totalization:  ‘ If totalization really is an ongoing process… ’.	verb	7
1374	1	That developing process is itself totalized through Sartre 's assertion that each totalization is the totalization of all struggles,  as it must be if the singular is to incarnate the universal.	verb	28
1375	1	In this case Sartre demonstrates how the singular universal works,  by appealing to the concrete example of a boxing match—  a random exemplification that just happens to reproduce the single adversaries of the master/slave dialectic.	verb	14

1378	1	Its totalization takes place through its incarnation,  as part of the totality of boxing,  in the overall framework within which each individual fight occurs.	verb	6
1379	1	Each boxing match,  Sartre claims,  must be both a unique event and also in some sense the incarnation of all boxing,  whose rules and conventions it follows,  and whose past and future history it sets itself against.	verb	17
1380	1	Yet each individual bout articulates itself within the framework of the history of boxing,  known and unknown.	verb	4
1381	1	The boxing match ‘ is the public incarnation of conflict ’ ( II,  32 ),  totalizing in its own struggle the whole of ‘ contemporary irreducibilities and fissures ’ ( II,  26 ):	verb	7

1384	1	thus one can and must say…  that each fight is the singularisation of all of the social whole in movement and that by this singularisation,  it incarnates the enveloping totalization which the historical process is.	verb	28
1385	1	But then he adds,  ‘ I have said and I repeat that we have not yet proved that this enveloping totalization exists ’.	verb	19
1386	1	So,  although it is possible to conceive of any event as an incarnation of the totality,  insofaras it must itself make up a part of that totality in its determination,  unlike the case of the boxing match,  where we can define the overall entity ‘ boxing ’,  it still remains unproven that an overall entity,  ‘ History ’,  can be said to exist atall.	verb	12
1387	1	It is simple enough for him to show that a boxing match takes place within a general totality of ‘ boxing ’,  which is itself only ever present in any individual incarnation,  for as a game each match is both an individual bout and something conducted accordingto general rules and a specific social tradition.	verb	31
1388	1	But what about those conflicts that do not take place within such a constituted social system,  such as conflictual bourgeois societies which can not be said to be unified,  except,  as Sartre suggests dismissively,  by appeal to a lost paradise before the class struggle?	verb	43
1389	1	His difficulty is accompanied by a nodoubt symptomatic increasing distrust of universals sothat,  in championing specificities against them,  he seems to give up the attempt to validate the universals—  History as Totalization—  that originally formed the object of his project.	verb	3
1390	1	His difficulty is accompanied by a nodoubt symptomatic increasing distrust of universals sothat,  in championing specificities against them,  he seems to give up the attempt to validate the universals—  History as Totalization—  that originally formed the object of his project.	verb	7

1392	1	As Sartre insists more and more upon the virtues of specificity ( II,  200—  05 ),  such is his distaste for Marxist or any other universalizing categories that he refuses even to countenance them,  attempting to replace concepts with specificities,  universals with singulars.	verb	8

1401	1	The divergence was sharpened by the application of a theoretical distinction,  the fruit of Augustinian theology,  amplified as the century went on by canon and Roman law reference;  princes pronounced their campaigns just wars ( fought against aggressors with the aim of re-establishing peace ) or public wars ( declared by a competent authority in the public interest ),  while they condemned the wars of lesser men as infractions of the peace.	verb	3

1404	1	Yet the logic of the definition suggested that it would benefit especially kings,  whose competence to declare war could not be impugned:  thus Thibaud of Blois failed to persuade the monks of Marmoutier that they owed him service when he fought against Louis VI;  they claimed discretion in the matter;  and in 1184,  the mighty Philip of Alsace hesitated to commit to battle the army he had summoned against Philip Augustus,  through fear that its ranks might melt away.	verb	60

1440	1	The assumption that all groups in the ‘ not-men ’ class are identical with eachother is so firmly rooted that,  as we shall see in the fourth section,  it is readily assumed even by modern libertarian thinkers that showing that,  forexample,  some ground for distinguishing between men and women is false or irrelevant,  immediately commits us to the view that the same ground is irrelevant in distinguishing men from children.	verb	66
1441	1	The attacks are based on empirical observation;  most women and older children are actually quite as rational as most men while some men are actually less rational.	verb	6
