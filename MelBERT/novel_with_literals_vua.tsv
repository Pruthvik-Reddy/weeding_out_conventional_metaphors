659	1	If one person chooses to cause serious injury another,  it should be presumed that he or she realizes that there is always a risk of death,  and such cases show a sufficiently wanton disregard for life asto warrant the label ‘ murder ’ if death results.	verb	VBZ	33
660	1	The counter-arguments,  which would uphold the principle of correspondence,  are that breach of principle is unnecessary when the amplitude of the crime of manslaughter lies murder,  and also that the definition of grievous bodily harm includes a number of injuries which are most unlikely to put the victim 's life risk.	verb	VBZ	19
